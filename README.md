# Seoul Bike Sharing Linear Regression Predictor

This repository contains code and documentation for building a linear regression model to predict the demand for bicycles in the Seoul bike sharing system.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to optimize operational efficiency by forecasting the demand for bicycles at any given hour, ensuring the availability of bikes when and where they are needed most.

## Steps:

### 1. Data Import
- Import Seoul bike sharing data from 'SeoulBikeSharing.csv'.

### 2. Dummy Variable Creation
- Create dummy variables for categorical features such as Seasons, Holiday, and Functioning Day.

### 3. Plotting and Descriptive Analysis
- Generate histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots to explore the distribution and relationships between variables.

### 4. Full Model Regression
- Perform linear regression analysis using all available variables.

### 5. Outlier and Influential Point Removal
- Identify and remove outliers and influential points from the dataset.

### 6. Model Selection
- Explore different model selection techniques like stepwise selection and Mallows' Cp to identify the most suitable regression model.

### 7 & 8. Test Performance Evaluation
- Compute performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared on the test set.

### 9. Model Comparison
- Compare different regression models to determine the most accurate one for predicting bike demand.

### 10. Prediction
- Use the selected regression model to make predictions on new data.

## Usage
- Clone the repository and run the provided SAS code to replicate the analysis.
- Refer to the detailed Microsoft Word report included in the repository for a comprehensive understanding of the project and data.
